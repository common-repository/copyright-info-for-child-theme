Copyright Info For Child Theme
this plugin is used to add copyright info to a child theme whaen the maain has pore copyright info system to begin width. This is not a subtute for your themes copyright info system but if your has the main themes has a pore copyright info system then this is the way to go not ideal but is the onely way I found you can do it with adding files to the child theme and causing an error.
